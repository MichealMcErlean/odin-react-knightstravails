# Knight's Travails UI
## An Odin Project exercise, re-created in React

Put a knight on a square on a chessboard, pick another square, work out the minimum moves to get the knight there. An old problem, and already solved - it's making a UI for interacting with the solver method which is the point of this exercise. I expect to have some trouble with this, I think I already see how to get the board to show the move locations in order, but animating a knight to jump around the route will be new for me.
